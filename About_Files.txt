Create Clean Dataframe (as csv) => output of data cleaning scripts:
----------------------------------
- zillow_clean_8_17a.R
- zillow_clean_8_17a_copy_wDates.R
- ZC_Reusable_Code.R => code used for analysis in other scripts reorganized as reusable functions

These files use the following inputs (from zillow/kaggle competition)
- properties_2016.csv
- train_2016_v2.csv
- sample_submission.csv

They output:
-----------------------------------
without transaction date field (and logerror as mean):
- clean_output.csv
- clean_TrainTest_output.csv

with transaction date field and (logerror unmodified from original):
- clean_output_wDates.csv
- clean_TrainTest_output_wDates.csv

Files ending in "_TrainTest" have about 90k records or so (merge has value for logerror in all records)
Files without this extension have close to 3M records where most have NA in the LogError fields
-----------------------------------

Scripts beyond this point expect the output of the above scripts as inputs.
While cleaning scripts expected inputs in an "input" directory, EDA scripts
were run from a data directory or with setwd() set to it so the script did not need
to specify it.

Folders To Refer To:
------------------------
- EDA_Source - Original Code files used as source for files in EDA section
- draft_code has all other draft content

EDA
------------------------
This should be an amaglam of the best EDA of the team
Organized to make it easier to find what we need for the final presentation

A series of R Markdown files on related content has been organized with 
file naming conventions starting with: "ZillowCase_01_Prelim."

If EDA files are structured from later in the process, they can get 02, etc.

Machine Learning and Modeling
--------------------------------

* There are a few preliminary models in EDA files (linear)
* R code for machine learning is in root of project (original unaltered files)
